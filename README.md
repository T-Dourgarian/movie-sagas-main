# Movie-gallery

## Description

Duration: One Weekend

This is a movie gallery where 14 popular movies are shown with their descriptions and genres along with a movie poster. The user can click on the poster image to view the details of just that movie, and can edit the title and the description if wanted. I utilized mainly react-redux and react-sagas to allow for the dynamic cross-page data storing and transferring.

Screenshots of different displays... movies-display, details page, edit page.
